The matrix $A$ of dimension $m\times n$, where $m\ll n$ is known.
And a linear measurement of $x$, $y = Ax$ is known, where $A$ is
a known matrix. The goal is to find $x$ from the measurement.
Without any assumptions on $x$, the system is
underdetermined and has a subspace of dimension at least $n-m$
solutions. But when it is known that most of the coordinates of
$x$ are zero (i.e., $x$ is sparse), useful estimates for the solution
$x$ can be obtained
and under some circumstances, the solution can be exactly recovered.
This report will discuss the main results that allow recovery of
sparse vectors from a linear measurement $Ax$.
